# RSO-Project-Prepih

Welcome to RSO-Project-Prepih, a university project developed as part of the course curriculum at [Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana](https://fri.uni-lj.si/sl/predmet/63541). This project is centered around building a comprehensive microservices application, specifically a photo gallery service named Postojna Photo Gallery and Service (PPGS).

## What We Do

PPGS is designed to provide an interactive platform for users to upload, manage, view photos on a map of Postojna and enhance the images using AI.

## Key Features & Technologies Used

### Microservices Architecture
The application is built using a microservices approach.

### CI/CD Pipeline
We utilize CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that our application is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.

### Cloud Database
Using ElephantSQL, a cloud-based PostgreSQL service, for our database needs.

### Containerization
Docker is used to containerize our services.

### Kubernetes Deployment
For orchestration, we employ Kubernetes, particularly Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), to manage and deploy our containerized applications.

### AI Integration
Incorporating AI to enhance photo quality and provide additional functionalities.

### Monitoring and Logging
Utilizing Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for data visualization, and Loki for log aggregation.

### Programming Languages and Frameworks
- **Node.js**: For building auth service.
- **Go with Gin Framework**: Employed for all the high-performance microservices.
